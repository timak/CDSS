    %     1. Smith,~J.~W., Everhart,~J.~E., Dickson,~W.~C., Knowler,~W.~C., \&
    %        Johannes,~R.~S. (1988). Using the ADAP learning algorithm to forecast
    %        the onset of diabetes mellitus.  In {\it Proceedings of the Symposium
    %        on Computer Applications and Medical Care} (pp. 261--265).  IEEE
    %        Computer Society Press.
    %
    %        The diagnostic, binary-valued variable investigated is whether the
    %        patient shows signs of diabetes according to World Health Organization
    %        criteria (i.e., if the 2 hour post-load plasma glucose was at least
    %        200 mg/dl at any survey  examination or if found during routine medical
    %        care).   The population lives near Phoenix, Arizona, USA.
    %
    %        Results: Their ADAP algorithm makes a real-valued prediction between
    %        0 and 1.  This was transformed into a binary decision using a cutoff of
    %        0.448.  Using 576 training instances, the sensitivity and specificity
    %        of their algorithm was 76% on the remaining 192 instances.
    %
    % 4. Relevant Information:
    %       Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from
    %       a larger database.  In particular, all patients here are females at
    %       least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.  ADAP is an adaptive learning
    %       routine that generates and executes digital analogs of perceptron-like
    %       devices.  It is a unique algorithm; see the paper for details.
